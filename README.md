## Problem Statement

Using the speed dating dataset from Kaggle, explore and visualize popular trends in speed dating.

## Executive Summary

Speed dating is defined as “an event at which each participant converses individually with all the prospective partners for a few minutes in order to select those with whom dates are desired.” This method may seem time-efficient; as both parties have a limited amount of time to get to know each other, they often prefer to get down to the concrete facts they prioritize to be important. Once the clock reaches its end, they move onto the ‘exit phase’ and ultimately decide whether there will be more interactions shortly. Due to its nature concerned with time, many claims that this type of personal encounters serve as a medium to get a quick grasp of the potential relationship it could bloom. The purpose of this data analysis is to find what are some factors that play a role in romantic attractions.

## Conclusion

After looking through different data analyses, it became clear that similarity is important in determining the success rate of matching with each other. Similarity allows each individual to be more vulnerable and open because it leads to the belief that the two individuals share similar ideals and values. This is supported by the shared hobbies in both gender and the very small age gap among the matched couples. Another important finding is that men put heavier emphasis on physical appearance than women. Physical appearance turned out to be the highest attribute among the male participants when intelligence was the highest attribute among the female participants. For now, social media dating applications could still be a more attractive option for some people due to its convenience. However, that may not be the case if one is successful in finding someone who shares the same interests. After all, a simple act such as attending a book club may increase the chance of finding a potential partner that could lead to a ‘happily forever after’.
